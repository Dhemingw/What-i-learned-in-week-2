## Return Functions
    * The return line in a function allows you to set the action of the function you are attempting and allows it to return an expected output
    *Ex: function multiply(num){
        return num * 5;
    }
    * This function will return whatever number we insert in the Parentheses beside "multiply" to be multiplied by 5 in our function the answer will look something like this multiply(5) = 25. The return function causes the 5 to be multiplied by 5 thus giving us 25.

## Boolean
    * Boolean allows for us to test if a variable or an expression is true or false.
    * It also allows you to compare variables to get a true or false result as well. 
    * Ex: (5 > 6 ) this will return false as 5 is not greater than 6.

## If 
    * The if function allows you to add "parameter" like features to a function to make for a more complex function. It adds conditions to allow for a function to continue running if it meets certain conditions.

## Index 
    * The index feature is a great way to find any given character in a string. Ex: Index[5] of the string 'Deontre' will return the 'r' in my name as the first character is always 0.
